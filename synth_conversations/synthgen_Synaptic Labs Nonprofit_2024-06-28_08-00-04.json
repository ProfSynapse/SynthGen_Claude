I'm really interested in contributing to their open-source initiatives, but I'm not sure how to balance that with their dual licensing model. How can I make meaningful contributions while ensuring I'm not accidentally infringing on their commercial licensing requirements? I'm particularly concerned about the distinction between small and large entities in their licensing agreement.",
